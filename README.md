This is a fork of [byesig for Ruby with Sorbet](https://github.com/itarato/byesig).

## TODO 

* Implement @spec folding.

## Options

- VSCode commands: force show and hide
- VSCode configuration:
  - opacity
  - backgroundColor
  - plugin on/off
  - fold on/off (Doesn't work too well at the moment)
  - gutter icon on/off

## Contribution

Still super beta, any feedback / issue / pull request is welcomed.
